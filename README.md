# Java Lessons Repository

Welcome to the Java Lessons Repository! 
This repository is a collection of Java programming exercises, challenges, and examples designed to enhance your coding skills in Java. 
Dive deep into object-oriented programming, tackle algorithmic problems, and refine your coding practices with hands-on lessons.

## What's Inside?

You will find Java files that cover a wide range of topics, from basic syntax to more complex programming concepts. 
Each exercise comes with a set of challenges that increase in difficulty, allowing you to progressively improve your coding skills.

## ScoreBoard Challenge

The ScoreBoard program is an interactive challenge that tests your understanding of Java classes, methods, and object-oriented programming. The main goal is to fix the existing code, complete the missing parts, and get the program running to track scores in a game.

### How to Get Started

To tackle the ScoreBoard challenge and other Java exercises:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

*git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/JavaLessons.git*

2. Open the cloned repository in your favorite Java IDE or editor.

3. Navigate to the specific lesson or challenge you want to work on.

4. Read the instructions provided in comments or accompanying files to understand the problem.

5. Start coding your solution!


### ScoreBoard Challenge Instructions
Level 1: Declare the missing player variables and complete the constructor.

Level 2: Add the missing getter and setter methods for the player variables.

Level 3: Complete the updateScore method and other missing logic to manage the scores correctly.

Challenge: Refactor the updateScore method using the template from the last lesson to handle score updates more efficiently.
